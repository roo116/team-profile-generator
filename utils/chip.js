// I need to be able to get the school name from the inquirer prompt.
    // that will be stored in answers.school.
    // so here is how that happens.   First I import some function that will use the data, I guess in this
    // case it will be the employee test js?  
    // get the API/prompt code in a separate function and then pass that data into the constructor as an argument
    //      maybe something like "const API = require(API)? and then have the constructor build from that?"
