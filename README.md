## Usage

Type `node index` at the command prompt and answer the questions.  
The assumption is only the manager of the team will be entering this information. As a result the first set of questions are specific to the user entering the answers.

Once the manager questions are answered, the user will then be presented with options to enter data for either Engineers or Interns, and will continue to prompt until the user has entered all employee data.

The application will output an index.html file in the ./dist folder of the application directory.
